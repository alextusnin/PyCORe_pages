# PyCORe, a fast tool for coupled-resonator microcombs simlation

Here we present our open-software solution for simulating arrays of coupled
microresonators. We explain how to install the library and all the
prerequisites to run your first simulations. We also explain how the data
organized and show a number of data analysis that constitute a minimal tool-box for numerical analysis of nonlnear dynamics and properties of the frequency combs in $\chi^{3}$ microresonators.
