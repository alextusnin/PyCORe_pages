```{admonition} Brief summary
:class: tip, dropdown
We extensively used PyCORe to explore nonlinear dynamics in a system of two coupled resonators on both sides of exceptional point. We investigated different regimes, such as perfect soliton crystals, bright-dark soliton pairs, soliton hopping, etc.

In this paper, where chaotic states of a microresonator were first used for laser ranging, we used PyCORe to verify experimental results and explore the preferable operation regime for such chaotic lidar

Alongside with the first experimental observation of a stable dissipative Kerr soliton in a system of four coupled resonators, PyCORe was used to verify the experiment.

In this paper, with PyCORe we theoretically investigated nonlinear dynamics in a resoantor with a synthetic frequency dimension. It is important to note, that recenlty the predicted states were observed experimentally (see [N. Englebert et al., "*Bloch oscillations of coherently driven dissipative solitons in a synthetic dimension*," Nat. Phys. (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02005-7) )
